Lich Dungeon

(A) Heroes on screen:
    + draw player characters
- load players textures

(B) Turn System:
+- Heroes decide what they want to do
- Player (lich) can do some actions
- Resolving - skipable animations + effects?

(And repeat?)

(C) Heroes Thoughts / Decision making system

(D) Room manager
- each room has objects
- each object has traits?
- some can act????

(E) Player card system?
- effects on card play

(F) Animation Handling?
- animations queue
- each is skipable with click / skip option
- each frame it is pinged to simulate animation frame
- if there are no animations, return priority?

#### GRAND TODO
- graphics
- new card draw + simple anim?
- turn move anim
- ending screen
- WINING / LOSING condition?
